## Privacy Policy for Project Hub for Sheets

**Last Updated:** July 6, 2025

This Privacy Policy describes how Project Hub for Sheets ("the Add-on") handles your information when you use our Google Sheets add-on.

### 1. Information We Do Not Collect

We want to be crystal clear: **Our Add-on does not collect, store, or transmit any of your personal data or any data from your Google Sheets to our servers or any third party.**

### 2. How the Add-on Works

The Add-on operates entirely within your Google account's environment. It requires permission to access your active spreadsheet for the sole purpose of performing its core functions, which include:

- Creating new sheets (e.g., "Overview," "Task Tracker").
- Adding headers and formatting to these sheets.
- Creating a custom menu to launch these functions.

All data remains in your Google Sheet, under your control, and is subject to Google's Privacy Policy. We do not have access to see, copy, or store any of your content.

### 3. Use of Google User Data

The Add-on's use of information received from Google APIs will adhere to the [Google API Services User Data Policy](https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy), including the Limited Use requirements.
